# 2048 Game

Welcome to Easy 2048, a simplified version of the classic 2048 game! This game is designed to be easy to understand and enjoyable for players of all ages.

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: The goal of the game is to combine numbered tiles to reach the 2048 tile.

2. **Gameplay**: Use the wsad keys to move all tiles in the desired direction: up, down, left, or right. All tiles will slide in the chosen direction until they hit the edge of the grid or another tile.

3. **Tile Combining**: When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile with the sum of their values. For example, when two tiles with the number 2 touch, they merge into a single tile with the number 4. Keep combining tiles to increase their value and free up space on the grid.

4. **Scoring**: Your score increases with each successful combination. Try to achieve the highest score possible!

5. **Winning**: The game is won when you create a tile with the number 2048. But don't stop there! You can keep playing to achieve an even higher score.

6. **Game Over**: The game is over when the grid is full and no more moves are possible. At this point, your final score will be displayed.
